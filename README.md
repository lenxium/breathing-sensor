# Breathing Sensor Design and Implementation
## Introduction
Traditional breathing monitoring methods are often manual, which are inefficient, prone to error, and not continuously tracked, yet irregular breathing or temporary cessation of breathing can be life-threatening if not noticed. This design includes a wearable breathing sensor that alerts the caregiver, thereby enabling prompt intervention.
